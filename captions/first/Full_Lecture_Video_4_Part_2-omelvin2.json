[{"text":"ok, we can also discover if the child exited due to a signal, so let's do that as well","width":512},{"text":"so let's say 'look if WIFSIGNALED then let's find out what singal it was'","width":704},{"text":"how do I pull out that? I think it's WSIGTERM? -TERMSIG, ah. ok","width":768},{"text":"and we can print out a helpful message right because not everyone knows those numbers so what is the number for SIGALARM? it's just this constant here","width":704},{"text":"SIGALARM. right, shall we run this? let's try it. see what errors we have here","width":576},{"text":"ok, what have I messed up. SIGALARM, argh, right, let's try that","width":1152},{"text":"ok, where's the mistake? line two","width":1280},{"text":"hooray! ok, so it prints 'Hello World', starts up and then the parent says 'child exited due to signal 14 alarm clock'","width":512},{"text":"let's make another program over here that - let's see, I'll tell you what I'll have a pointer","width":896},{"text":"there we go, and it can be a random number","width":256},{"text":"just cast that into an integer pointer and into p we will write the value 42","width":448},{"text":"will it crash? who knows what it'll do","width":384},{"text":"ok, so this time we go 'child exited due to signal 11' what's signal 11? well ok it's not going to get you invited to any parties","width":512},{"text":"but it's turns out signal 11 happens to be segfault","width":256},{"text":"so, we could keep going with this and say 'look if the thing was' - I'll just write it - 11. I could spend some time - \"oops, seg fault - write a better a program!\"","width":1536},{"text":"so you see those messages like segmentation fault and an erro that commonly comes up that says 'segfault write a better program'","width":384},{"text":"right, so, you see those messages like alarm clock, segmentation fault, that kind of stuff. they dont' just appear in the terminal by magic, no!","width":512},{"text":"the shell is doing what we're doing here and that's what your fake program is going to do. after a command finishes use these macros to discover what happened to your child and print out the relevant information","width":1088},{"text":"so, questions about that?","width":448},{"text":"alright, so, now you actually have enough knowledge to write not only make, but a shell","width":512},{"text":"and we're going to have an MP based on that where we can take just user input, what you type onto a keyboard and then start executing programs","width":768},{"text":"so the shell that we normally see is either bash or a simpler version called just sh, but it's just a C program that reads input and then calls exec()","width":640},{"text":"based on what you typed","width":320},{"text":"ok, other questions about this?","width":256},{"text":"alright then, let's have a look at some other questions on here","width":320},{"text":"so, when I start my program and I want to find out what arguments it was given. so for example, suppose someone did this","width":896},{"text":"how would I actually discover the first argument?
