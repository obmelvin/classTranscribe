[{"text":"what's POSIX?","width":512},{"text":"does anyone know what it stands for?","width":192},{"text":"ok, so, a long time ago back in the '80s the standards comittes of IEEE were trying to formalize a standard set of interfaces for an operating system","width":832},{"text":"or what operating systems should support","width":192},{"text":"and it went by an IEEE number which was hard to remember so at some point, i think it was Stormunds said why don't we call it the Portable Operating System Interface, or POSIX for short","width":832},{"text":"so POSIX is just a set of standards","width":192},{"text":"and what do those standars talk about?","width":256},{"text":"well they talk about system of interfaces to the actual operating system","width":448},{"text":"in others words what system calls can I make to control the operating system or request things from the operating sytem","width":512},{"text":"and also it's a set of utilites that you expect to exist","width":256},{"text":"so for example, there should be ls in order to list files or cd in order to change directory","width":512},{"text":"and also it describes what you can expect on the platform","width":320},{"text":"like I can expect to work with files,I can expect to work with a netowrk","width":320},{"text":"so a POSIX operating system provides an abstraction of the low level hardware","width":384},{"text":"I don't need to worry about the exact way to communicate with a flash drive","width":576},{"text":"I can simply say 'oh look well let's assume theres a file system on here' and I want to be able to read or write files to this","width":576},{"text":"and the operating system provides a lot of support for this different pieces of hardware","width":384},{"text":"it also provides security. so what kind of security does an operating system give you?","width":896},{"text":"does it give you a warm blanket and a teddy bear at night? no","width":384},{"text":"so what do we mean by security?","width":128},{"text":"if you were to design an operating system today, right now, what security features would you have?","width":448},{"text":"make it memory safe, what do you mean by that? why?","width":640},{"text":"ok, so what you're saying is you don't trust his programs?","width":448},{"text":"I'm sorry, yeah it's a fact of life. what we want to try to do is provide some insulation between different user programs","width":384},{"text":" so that a malfunctioning program I'm sure you write fantastic code most of the time, but let's say a malfunctionoing user program cannot bring down the rest of the system","width":832},{"text":"ok, so how are we going to do that? well one thing you've already seen is memory protection","width":576},{"text":"and if I read up on operating systems give us virtual memory","width":320},{"text":"so each little process runs inside it's own padded shell","width":320},{"text":"sorry padded inside its own padded room","width":256},{"text":"it thinks it can read or write any possible memory address it can think of","width":320},{"text":"of course if it tries to do that","width":128},{"text":"it might crash and we might just kill the process","width":256},{"text":"by the first flush one process cannot actually access another process","width":320},{"text":"they live in completely different universes so they are living in dfiferent virtual memory spaces","width":384},{"text":"ok, what else?","width":448},{"text":"yes? file permissions","width":384},{"text":"yes, so I can make it so you can't delete my file or append to my file","width":256},{"text":"but I will let you read it","width":128},{"text":"or I can make it so that my file is unreadable by anybody that's not inside a certain group","width":512},{"text":"yes, interrupts, what about interrupts?","width":448},{"text":"ok, interrupts - i'm going to talk about processes because I thoguth that's what you were getting at","width":512},{"text":"that you can't kill my process","width":192},{"text":"you can't just call kill -9 on my processs","width":256},{"text":"so you can only kill processes which you own","width":128},{"text":"unless you happen to be root or super user in which case you can kill any process you want on your system","width":384},{"text":"so, yes, security in terms of process control","width":320},{"text":"the last thing here is scheduling","width":128},{"text":"try to have some fairness","width":320},{"text":"which is an open ended and debated term, but imagine your process tries to take the CPU 100% of the time and never gives it up. just has a while loop","width":768},{"text":"if we were not careful no one else would have access to the CPU, it wouldn't get any work done","width":576},{"text":"so the last thing we'll say in the closing part of lecture","width":128},{"text":"is yes there is a quiz on friday and here's going to be our next topic - how do we allocate memory on the heap","width":576},{"text":"and I will talk about this in a future lecture on monday","width":320},{"text":"alright, great, see you friday, be ready for the quiz","width":320},{"text":"thank you very much, have a good section tomorrow","width":256}]
