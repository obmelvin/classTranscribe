[{"text":"what's POSIX?","width":485},{"text":"does anyone know what it stands for?","width":238},{"text":"ok, so, a long time ago back in the '80s the standards committees of IEEE were trying to formalize a standard set of interfaces for an operating system","width":801},{"text":"or what operating systems should support","width":158},{"text":"and it went by an IEEE number which was hard to remember so at some point, i think it was Stormunds said why don't we call it the Portable Operating System Interface, or POSIX for short","width":815},{"text":"so POSIX is just a set of standards","width":264},{"text":"and what do those standards talk about?","width":105},{"text":"well they talk about system of interfaces to the actual operating system","width":544},{"text":"in others words what system calls can I make to control the operating system or request things from the operating sytem","width":464},{"text":"and also it's a set of utilites that you expect to exist","width":345},{"text":"so for example, there should be ls in order to list files or cd in order to change directory","width":582},{"text":"and also it describes what you can expect on the platform","width":254},{"text":"like I can expect to work with files,I can expect to work with the network","width":258},{"text":"so a POSIX operating system provides an abstraction of the low level hardware","width":590},{"text":"I don't need to worry about the exact way to communicate with a flash drive","width":434},{"text":"I can simply say 'oh look well let's assume theres a file system on here' and I want to be able to read or write files to this","width":434},{"text":"and the operating system provides a lot of support for those different pieces of hardware","width":479},{"text":"it also provides security. so what kind of security does an operating system give you?","width":946},{"text":"does it give you a warm blanket and a teddy bear at night? no","width":337},{"text":"so what do we mean by security?","width":115},{"text":"if you were to design an operating system today, right now, what security features would you have?","width":473},{"text":"make it memory safe, what do you mean by that? why?","width":637},{"text":"ok, so what you're saying is you don't trust his programs?","width":370},{"text":"I'm sorry, yeah it's a fact of life. what we want to try to do is provide some insulation between different user programs","width":505},{"text":" so that a malfunctioning program I'm sure you write fantastic code most of the time, but let's say a malfunctioning user program cannot bring down the rest of the system","width":801},{"text":"ok, so how are we going to do that? well one thing you've already seen is memory protection","width":586},{"text":"and if I read up on operating systems give us virtual memory","width":300},{"text":"so each little process runs inside it's own padded shell","width":368},{"text":"sorry padded inside its own padded room","width":168},{"text":"it thinks it can read or write any possible memory address it can think of","width":319},{"text":"of course if it tries to do that","width":151},{"text":"it might crash and we might just kill the process","width":255},{"text":"by the first flush one process cannot actually access another process","width":334},{"text":"they live in completely different universes so they are living in dfiferent virtual memory spaces","width":450},{"text":"ok, what else?","width":307},{"text":"yes? file permissions","width":452},{"text":"yes, so I can make it so you can't delete my file or append to my file","width":273},{"text":"but I will let you read it","width":112},{"text":"or I can make it so that my file is unreadable by anybody that's not inside a certain group","width":514},{"text":"interrupts, what about interrupts?","width":472},{"text":"ok, interrupts - i'm going to talk about processes because I thought that's where you were going to go","width":349},{"text":"that you can't kill my process","width":269},{"text":"you can't just call kill -9 on my processs","width":185},{"text":"so you can only kill processes which you own","width":187},{"text":"unless you happen to be root or super user in which case you can kill any process you want on your system","width":466},{"text":"so, yes, security in terms of process control","width":235},{"text":"the last thing here is scheduling","width":95},{"text":"try to have some fairness","width":426},{"text":"which is an open ended and debated term, but imagine your process tries to take the CPU 100% of the time and never gives it up. just has a while loop","width":729},{"text":"if we were not careful no one else would have access to the CPU, it wouldn't get any work done","width":548},{"text":"so the last thing we'll say in the closing part of lecture","width":145},{"text":"is yes there is a quiz on friday and here's going to be our next topic - how do we allocate memory on the heap","width":585},{"text":"and I will talk about this in a future lecture on monday","width":312},{"text":"alright, great, see you friday, be ready for the quiz","width":326},{"text":"thank you very much, have a good section tomorrow","width":236}]
