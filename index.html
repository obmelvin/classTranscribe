            You are invited to participate in a University of Illinois study. We are conducting research on the effect that transcribing video has on class performance. This research has the potential to benefit society by providing new tools for reinforcing concepts learned during lecture. The investigators are Lawrence Angrave, a professor in the Computer Science Department, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, and the senior undergraduate researcher Jia Chen Ren. In order to protect you from any undue influence, Dr. Angrave will not be involved in the experiment until after the semester is over; in particular, he will not know whether or not you participated until after final grades have been assigned.
            </p>

            <p>
            You will be asked to voluntarily participate a few experimental sessions, which you can do using any standard web-enabled device at any location convenient to you. During each session, you will watch and transcribe up to 10 minutes of a CS 241 lecture. Participants may complete as many transcription sessions as they would like over the remainder of the semester, however it is expected that most will complete one hour or less.  Your transcriptions will be recorded and may be used for features including closed captioning and video search. Your CS241 quiz scores will also be used in this study, but any copy we make of your quiz scores will be linked only to a uniquely generated confidential key.  The only link between the key and your name will be one spreadsheet file that does not contain any other information about you, and which will be stored on the University of Illinois box.com server, with permissions set so that it is accessible only to the experimenters (Jia Chen Ren, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, and, only after final grades for CS 241 have been assigned, Lawrence Angrave).  No other information about you will be stored on any computer, or released to any person outside the University of Illinois. Dissemination of experimental results may include conference paper(s), journal paper(s) and a thesis.  Your data and any personally identifiable information will be kept confidential; only aggregated statistics will be reported.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you transcribe at least 20 minutes in any given week, you will be compensated for participation by having your name entered in a lottery.  One winner per week, selected at random from those who participate, will receive a $100 cash prize.
            </p>

            <p>
            There are no known risks in this study except that: (1) you may find the task tedious, (2) you are subject to all of the usual risks that people experience while using personal computers, including for example the risk of repetitive stress injury.  You are welcome to take a break at any time. The University does not provide compensation for any injury sustained as a result of participation in a research study, except as required by law.  Your decision whether or not to participate will not affect your future relations with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. You are under no obligation to participate in the study. You are free to discontinue participation in the study at any time. If you have any questions at any time, I will be happy to answer them. You can reach Mark Hasegawa-Johnson at jhasegaw@illinois.edu or Jia Chen Ren at jren4@illinois.edu. Should you have any questions concerning research subject's rights, you can contact the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board Office, (217) 333-2670; e-mail irb@illinois.edu.
