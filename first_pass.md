## 7. Follow the following consistency guidelines
* When transcribing terms... ask yourself: If you were to search for this term, what would you search for? Then write that term down. (ie. write "printf" instead of "print f")
* Generally don't worry about capitalization. Use punctuation as you see fit.
* Write out "non-technical numbers" as words. Write out "technical numbers" as numbers. ie. “Print hello six times” and “There are 8 bits in a byte”.

## 8. When you are finished, click "Submit Transcription"
